<h7>A visualisation of the phases of alteration in building floors, in the Chelsea neighbourhood of Manhattan, brings out two periods of influx. However, they were both for different reasons. First, in the 1980s, due to an intangible event and second, in the 2000s due to a physical intervention. The sudden addition and renovation of floors in 1980s (shown in yellow), also known as the period of 'skyscraper boom' in New York, was thanks to lucrative Wall Street years, while the influx of building floors in 2000s (shown in green) was post the construction of the Highline. The Highline was constructed in 2009 following which there was a sudden rise in the price of buildings around. This also conincided with the rezoning of the neighbourhood which allowed for higher stories to be built. What resulted is a sudden boom in the addition of floors. A more precise list can be seen at

A scatter plot was the best way to show the clustering and dispersion of data points to emphasise on the influx of building floors during a specified period. The colours for each alteration in floors is different and the visualition is a GIF to see the change happening more clearly.
